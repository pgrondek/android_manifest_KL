Getting Started
---------------

To get started with my repo, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using my trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/nerull7/android_manifest.git -b kitkat

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

    $ repo sync
